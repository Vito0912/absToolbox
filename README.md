# absToolbox

# NEW

Now available at https://abstoolbox.vito0912.de/ with easy access. Run these tools in seconds without any other program needed. Also works with local ABS servers.

---

A collection of tools designed to assist with Audiobookshelf-related tasks.

> [!CAUTION]
> All scripts may have unforeseen side effects or might even crash the server completely. Therefore, before starting any script, you should make a backup via the settings! Do not use the Python scripts anymore. These are legacy!

> [!NOTE]  
> Old, but still valid note:\
> Currently, these are ~~only~~ Python scripts. However, there are plans to implement plugin support:
> [Plugin Support Pull Request](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/pull/3745)
>
> Should this happen, I will try to integrate all scripts into ABS and create additional ones. Depending on how access to the database/UI is provided, possible developments include:
> - An issue tracker with an interface for management (if it is possible to register a settings page)
> - Ratings (if it is possible to access the database and/or create a custom table, and if the item view is customizable)
> - Shared listening states (if there is access to the database)
